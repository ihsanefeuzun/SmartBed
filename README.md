You can check those files that to see what we did wit UI Flow. 

final.m5f file contains only button actions and time counter.

remote.m5f file contains sync. saved data to EzData to keep track of the time. 

We can improve our code by changing saving datas to EzData doing it async. and add graph to show datas with Remote+.
